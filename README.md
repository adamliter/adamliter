## Adam Liter (⚛️💡r)

Hi there! I'm Adam, a machine learning practitioner currently working at
Glassdoor. A bit more about me:

- I enjoy working on NLP problems, as I have a background in linguistics (PhD
  from University of Maryland).
- I'm a "full-stack" ML practitioner who enjoys working on all aspects of an ML
  project, from product conceptualization and discovery, to data engineering,
  from model training, to model productionization.
- I particularly enjoy the DevOps side of things, and have two Kubernetes
  certifications, the [CKA][cka] and [CKAD][ckad].
